Description of new repository for subject Machine Learning/Deep Learning in the academic year 2020-1.

ML/DL Project No.1
•Do experiment on deep-Classification using MNIST dataset of hand-written digits, 0~9. 
Obtain your own validation errors by showing confusion matrices. Choose one of the following two versions:

•Python Tensorflow Version
1) Use ResNet-18 (You may use pre-Trained paramaters)
2) Download MNIST Dataset (train: 60000 + test: 10000)
3) Install PyCharm3.6 or Anaconda3 & import appropriate libraries (tensorflow, keras, tensorboard, etc.)(tensorflow, keras, tensorboard, etc.)
4) Download a known source from GITHUB (ResNet-18
•Matlab Version
